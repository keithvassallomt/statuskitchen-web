                Status Kitchen is designed to respect your privacy. We believe that your desktop environment is your personal space, and we have no interest in tracking how you use it.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>The Status Kitchen desktop application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong> It runs entirely locally on your machine.
            </p>

            <h3>The Cookbook</h3>
            <p>
                When you use the Status Kitchen Cookbook (this website or the in-app browser), standard web server logs (IP address, User Agent) may be processed by our hosting provider (AWS) for security and operational purposes. We do not use third-party analytics cookies.
            </p>

            <h3>Updates</h3>
            <p>
                The application may check for updates by querying GitHub Releases. This interaction is subject to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" class="text-gnome-blue hover:underline">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>.
